            Full truckload service, commonly referred to as FTL, is a type of
            shipping mode whereby a truck carries one dedicated shipment. In other
            words, the journey is reserved for one shipment only. FTL trucking has
            several advantages over the alternative trucking shipment mode, LTL, or
            less than a full truckload shipment. Super Ego Logistics provides
            transportation solutions that align with your supply chain goals and

            contracted freight. Our specialists can provide service for dry vans and
