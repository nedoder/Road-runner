        Full truckload service, commonly referred to as FTL, is a type of
        shipping mode whereby a truck carries one dedicated shipment. In other
        words, the journey is reserved for one shipment only. FTL trucking has
        several advantages over the alternative trucking shipment mode, LTL, or
        less than a full truckload shipment. Super Ego Logistics provides
        transportation solutions that align with your supply chain goals and
        needs, whether it is a spot shipment, next day, project-based or
        contracted freight. Our specialists can provide service for dry vans and
        temperature-controlled capacity by understanding your business needs.
