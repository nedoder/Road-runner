      <p>
        Expedited shipping service is a type of shipping that involves using
        faster methods to transport goods. This can include using a faster mode
        of transportation, such as shipping the goods directly to the customer
        instead of going through a retailer first. Super Ego Logistics has
        developed a network for drivers to pick up and deliver expedited
        shipments as quickly as possible. Our networks consist of all types of
        equipment with teams, box trucks, cargo vans, etc.
