      <h3>Expert hazmat trucking transport</h3>
      <p>
        Hazmat trucking is the transport of hazardous materials, which could be
        anything from hazardous gasses or poisons to waste or radioactive
        materials. The cargo could cause harm either on its own or when it comes
        into contact with air, flame, water, or other chemicals. Safe driving is
        always a priority, and it's critically important in hazmat trucking.
        Drivers hauling a hazmat load have the added stress of ensuring they are
        following the additional regulations for this type of cargo. Plus, they
        may need to avoid certain routes to detour around hazmat-restricted
        areas. Super Ego Logistics has hazmat-certified drivers and trucks in
        our network ready to move your hazardous materials to their destination
        and fleet managers trained in the most optimized routing that can make
        it easier for drivers.
