        Less than truckload freight shipping (LTL) is used for the
        transportation of small freight or when freight doesn't require the use
        of an entire trailer. This shipping method can be used when freight
        weighs between 150 and 15,000 pounds. Super Ego Logistics has
        consolidation centers in major metropolitan cities to combine the
        freight, save on cost and be able to get nationwide converge.
