The cargo could cause harm either on its own or when it comes into contact with air, flame, water, or other chemicals. Safe driving is always a priority, and it's critically important in hazmat trucking. Drivers hauling a hazmat load have the added stress of ensuring they are following the additional regulations for this type of cargo. Plus, they may need to avoid certain routes to detour around hazmat-restricted areas.
